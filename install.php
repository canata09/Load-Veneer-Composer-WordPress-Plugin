# Step 1: Create a new directory for your plugin
mkdir my-plugin
cd my-plugin

# Step 2: Initialize a new Composer project
composer init

# Follow the prompts to set up your project. You can accept the defaults for most options.

# Step 3: Add dependencies
# For example, to add the "guzzlehttp/guzzle" package:
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

# Step 4: Create your plugin file
# Create a new file named "my-plugin.php" in your plugin directory. This is the main file for your plugin.
# Here's a basic example of what this file might look like:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: My Plugin
 * Description: This is my plugin.
 * Version: 1.0
 * Author: Your Name
 */

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

function my_plugin_function() {
    $client = new Client();
    // Use the Guzzle client...
}

add_action('init', 'my_plugin_function');
